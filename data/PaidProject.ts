    the problem is simple how about if i have sensitive data like phone number, address, and other if the data can breach from sql cause cycber attack?
    
    so just enkrip data in table with crythografi, with custom key or chipher if data breach attacker need key for decript data. why custom key? caused this will make harder for get pwned.
