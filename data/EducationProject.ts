      Software development isn't just about building CRUD apps—it's about solving real problems through algorithms and logic. This project demonstrates my attempt to implement optical character recognition (OCR) in PHP using the Tesseract engine. 

      Rather than relying on high-level libraries from Python like scikit-learn, I chose to work with a lower-level implementation to understand the inner workings of OCR technology. The application includes two main features: document scanning and text recognition.

      It was a challenging but rewarding learning process, involving a lot of reading, trial-and-error, and iteration. Every asset and icon used in this project is solely for development and educational purposes. I'm not an expert—just a continuous learner.

      This is a custom PHP library built to support my undergraduate thesis. It contains a collection of commonly used algorithms and methods in academic research, especially for students writing their final reports or theses ("skripsi").

      The library is packaged and available via Composer, making it easy to integrate with any PHP project. It's meant to help automate repetitive statistical or algorithmic tasks often required during academic data analysis.

      This project is a custom-built MVC framework created entirely in native PHP. Inspired by CodeIgniter and Laravel, it combines object-oriented programming with procedural logic. 

      The framework was developed in Bahasa Indonesia and served as the backend for my final exam project. It includes routing, controllers, basic templating, and a minimal ORM-like structure—suitable for beginners and educational purposes.
