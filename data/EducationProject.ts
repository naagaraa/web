         build software is not about only about CRUD but evertything.
                  and it's not about tech stack, framework, is it about how to
                  implement algorithm into the program. make algorithm is not
                  about use libraries like you know sci learn in python. but it
                  can make in another language. a good programmer can learn any
                  language but maybe only have one or two language for mastery.
                  and this DEMO my project this is simple, but is so hard for
                  implementation algorithm, need reading, thingking again and
                  again hahaha lol, I am not expert just learner.
                  every assets and icon what i used this project is not for
                  ecommerce just used for development. what fiture I build for
                  this project ? i am try implementation in two fiture, text
                  scanner and document scanner
