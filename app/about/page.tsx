            I am a dedicated Information Technology student with a robust
            foundation in programming and technical support. Over the past three
            years, I have honed my skills in PHP, further expanding my expertise
            by diving into languages such as Bash, Java, JavaScript, Python, and
            TypeScript. Recently, I have returned to PHP, specializing in
            Laravel, where Iâ€™ve been able to leverage my programming skills to
            create dynamic web applications.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-10 mb-3">
            My technical proficiency is complemented by a solid understanding of
            virtualization technologies, including VMware and VirtualBox. I
            develop primarily on Ubuntu OS, allowing me to harness the power of
            open-source tools for effective software development.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-10 mb-3">
            In addition to my programming capabilities, I bring a wealth of
            experience in IT support, including server migration and network
            administration. My background equips me to solve complex problems
            and provide effective solutions, ensuring optimal system
            performance.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-10 mb-3">
            I am passionate about continuous learning and thrive in
            collaborative environments, always eager to embrace new challenges
            in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
